# Path@Penn Mobile Registration – Static Opening Screen

This repository contains the HTML and CSS implementation of the **opening screen** of my high-fidelity Path@Penn prototype. The page replicates the inputs, layout, colors, and example data from my design and is optimized for a phone-sized viewport.
